Website Performance Analysis

Overview
The Website Performance Analysis project involves analyzing the performance of a website using time series data. The project aims to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns in website traffic over time. It utilizes various data analysis techniques to help understand user behavior and optimize the performance of a website based on data-driven insights.

This project leverages Python and popular data analysis libraries to perform in-depth statistical analysis and visualization. The main focus is on time series forecasting and performance metrics like sessions, bounce rate, and conversion rates.

Features

Data Preprocessing:
-Handling missing values and outliers.
-Converting raw website traffic data into a time series format for analysis.

Time Series Analysis:
-Implemented techniques to identify autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation in the website's session data.
-Seasonal decomposition to identify trend, seasonal, and residual components.

Forecasting:
-Difference transformation of the time series data to stabilize the variance and ensure stationarity.
-Visualizing autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) to identify lags for model building.

Statistical Visualization:
-Visual representations of key metrics like Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation.
-Graphs displaying trends and seasonality of website sessions.
Modeling:

Utilized ARIMA models for time series forecasting.
Evaluating model accuracy using performance metrics such as MSE (Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Tools and Libraries
Python: The core programming language for the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and time series analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing the time series data.
Statsmodels: For implementing ACF, PACF, and time series forecasting models like ARIMA.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for writing code, running analysis, and documenting findings.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WebsitePerformanceAnalysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd WebsitePerformanceAnalysis
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook WebsitePerformanceAnalysis.ipynb
Load your dataset, preferably in .csv format with columns related to website performance (e.g., Sessions, Bounce Rate, Conversion Rate).
Run the cells to preprocess data, visualize trends, and analyze the time series.
Example Output
Autocorrelation & Partial Autocorrelation Plots: These graphs help identify relationships within the data at different time lags, crucial for time series forecasting.

Time Series Decomposition: Breaks down the website traffic data into trend, seasonality, and residuals to better understand the underlying patterns.

Future Improvements
Add support for more advanced machine learning algorithms like Facebook Prophet or LSTM for time series forecasting.
Integrate website performance metrics beyond sessions, such as page load time, user engagement, and more.
Implement real-time data analysis using live website traffic data streams.
