# Website Performance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of website performance metrics, aimed at understanding how various factors impact user experience and site efficiency. The project leverages data visualization and statistical analysis to provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) for websites.

## Objectives

- Analyze website performance metrics such as load time, page speed, and user engagement.
- Identify factors that contribute to optimal website performance.
- Provide visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset

The dataset includes metrics such as:
- **Page Load Time**: The time taken for a webpage to fully load.
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: The time taken to receive the first byte of data from the server.
- **User Engagement Metrics**: Data on user interactions and bounce rates.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering performance metrics from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to identify trends and correlations.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to understand relationships between variables.
5. **Visualization**: Creating graphs and charts to present findings effectively.

## Tools and Libraries

This analysis is conducted using Python with the following libraries:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Results

The analysis highlights key performance metrics and identifies areas for improvement, helping stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance website performance and user experience.

## Conclusion

Understanding website performance is crucial for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction. This analysis provides valuable insights that can guide optimization efforts, ultimately leading to better performance and higher conversion rates.
